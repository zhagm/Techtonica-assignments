How does one device find another itâ€™s trying to communicate with?

How can we send data reliably even if the network is unreliable?
    The great thing about the internet is that it is fault-tolerant, meaning there are multiple paths for information to travel. Routers determine what paths packets take, and if one path is down there are many others. The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) will check that all the packets made it to the destination, anything that hasn't made it is communicated to the sending device by the TCP and resent.
